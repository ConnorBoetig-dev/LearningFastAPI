# .env FILE - ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# =============================================================================================
# This file stores configuration that gets injected into your Docker containers.
# WHY: Keeps secrets & config out of code. Different values for dev/staging/prod.
# CONNECTION: docker-compose.yml reads this file and passes variables to containers.

# MinIO admin login (you define these)
# -----------------------------
# These are the credentials MinIO will create on first boot.
# You will use them to log into the MinIO web console (http://localhost:9001)
# and your app will use them to talk to MinIO via the S3 API.

# -----------------------------
# How the FastAPI app reaches MinIO
# -----------------------------
# Inside Docker Compose, services can reach each other by service name.
# Our MinIO service is named "minio", so the app calls http://minio:9000
#
# KEY CONCEPT: Docker Compose creates a private network for your containers.
# The "api" container can reach the "minio" container using the service name "minio" as the hostname.
# From your host machine (browser), you use localhost:9000.
# From inside the api container, you use minio:9000.
